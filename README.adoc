
This service is a payment gateway for merchants to process payments

The acquiring bank that will process the payment is simulated in this service and will return insufficient funds if the amount is higher than 50 pounds

Ths service is developed using java 11 , gradle and Spring Boot and will use an h2 in memory database.

The service can be run with ./gradlew bootRun and should be testable through local swagger ui : http://localhost:9999/swagger-ui.html

The details of payments are saved to the in memory database with encryption



The service does NOT have login feature, there should be a separate login with oauth that the vendors use to login and get a token with, which will be used by this service to authenticate and authorize the vendor.

The service needs end to end testing for its functionalities that can be set up with a framework like Cucumber
